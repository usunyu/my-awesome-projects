# Example Scene: Light Tracking

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for using light
tracking and observing the luminance level within a scene.

Located in the top right is a luminance level indicator, and will update
based on the light conditions in your environment.

Based on the lighting conditions, the plant model will either grow
or retracted back into the planter. You should also notice the
ambient intensity change in the scene as well.

You can use the controller (Bumper) to lock/unlock the plant model
movement. When unlocked, the plant model will follow the head postion
using world raycast.

## Bumper
Toggles the plant model movement between locked and unlocked.
