# Example Scene: InputModule

This example scene demonstrates the MLInputModule, which implements a seamless integration
between Magic Leap input with the native Unity UI elements. The Input Module specifies
which input (Headpose, Eye Tracking, or Control) will be taken as a pointer and which
control input (either Bumper or Trigger) executes a 'button click'.

The Input Module interacts with all Canvases with the MLInputRaycaster component.

The following events are currently supported: PointerEnter, PointerExit, PointerDown,
PointerUp, PointerClick, Select, Deselect, Scroll.

## Trigger or Bumper
- Register as a 'button click' event
