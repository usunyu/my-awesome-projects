# Example Scene: Mobile App

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for receiving input
from a Magic Leap Mobile App (MLA).

When an MLA is connected, this example shows the MLA connection status in the UI.
A mobile phone model shows the state of the buttons and touch input. This model
follows your mobile device with 3 DoF rotational data after calibration is completed.
Positional data is not available for MLA. When an MLA is disconnected, the example
also updates the MLA connection status in the UI.

Controllers get ignored in this example and MLA connection status in the UI will
show as disconnected if only a controller is connected.
