# Example Scene: Hand Meshing

This example demonstrates and prescribes preferred methods for hand meshing. The
example provides a HandMeshingExample script that drives parameters of the 
meshing API through the MLHandMeshingBehavior.

The example uses Hand Gestures to control the rendering mode. Using your right hand,
hold up the 'Ok' gesture for 2 seconds to switch to the next render mode.

Render Modes:
  Occlusion - Using an unlit black material, anything behind the hand
    will be occluded.
  Flat - The hand mesh will be rendered with an unlit white material
  Wireframe - The hand mesh will be rendered with a wireframe material
  Paused - The hand mesh will stop updating, freezing any mesh previously
    acquired.
