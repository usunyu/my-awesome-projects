# Example Scene: World Scale

Description:
This example is presented with two individual scenes, one scene uses world
scale:1 (meters) and the other scene uses world scale:100 (centimeters).
In each scene the user can adjust a physical marker along a ruler to gauge
the real world distance of the marker. The on screen text depicts the world
scale and the distance from the controller to the marker, using the current
unit of measurement.

## Touchpad Swipe Up/Down:
Adjust the distance of the marker within the range of
(0.25 - 1) Meters or (25 - 100) Centimeters respectively.
