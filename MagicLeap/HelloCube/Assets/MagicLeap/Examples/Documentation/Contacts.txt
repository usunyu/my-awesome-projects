# Example Scene: Contacts

Pre-requisites:
- Mobile App connected
- Cloud Login

Description:
This example demonstrates the use of the Contacts API and can manage existing
contacts on the device. Initially, a list of available contacts is shown. Tapping
on a contact or the add new contact button, on the upper right, will load the
contact for viewing/editing. You can view/modify the name, email addresses, and
phone numbers associated with that contact.

You can search through all your contacts by entering a query in the search field.
The search query is case-insensitive and looks for matches in the name, phone
number, or email address.

You can simulate deleting a non-existent contact via the red button beside the
search query. This will invoke a delete contact command but with an invalid id.
